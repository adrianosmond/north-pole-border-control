# North Pole: Border Control

This game was built by [Adrian Osmond](https://github.com/adrianosmond). It was based on 
[Day 4 of the 2020 Advent of Code pu]zzle(https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4), which was
excellently created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). The cartoon faces used
in the passport photos come from the [Avataaars](https://avataaars.com/) library by 
[Pablo Stanley](https://twitter.com/pablostanley) and use [Fang-Pen Lin's](https://twitter.com/fangpenlin) [Avataaars React Component](https://github.com/fangpenlin/avataaars).
