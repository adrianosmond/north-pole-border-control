      It's that time of year again, and people are flocking to the North Pole.
      This year seems more frantic than the others however, so the
      Administrative Officialdom Council (AOC) of the North Pole has decided to
      bring in new workers to help deal with the extra influx of people at the
      border. This is where you come in...
    </p>
    <p className="mt-6">
      Since we haven't worked with you before, we want to test your skills
      before we give you a permanent contract. We're going to give you 60
      seconds to get through as many passports as you can. Don't worry though,
      North Pole labour laws don't allow us to get you to work for us for
      free... You'll be paid $100 for every person you correctly approve or deny
      entry to the North Pole, but you'll be fined $500 for any incorrect
      decisions you make. You can approve people by clicking the thumbs up (üëç)
      button, or pressing 'A' on your keyboard. You can deny people by clicking
      the thumbs down button (üëé) or by pressing 'D' on your keyboard.
